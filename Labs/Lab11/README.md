For this assignment, I used the resources listed down below to get my API to work as well as get the details for books.
    For a general, better understanding of API's, I used this website.
        https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started
    I also looked at this video for a better understanding of it. I will admit, I chose to not really
    implement any of its code, as it was going for a more complex look than I wanted.

    Of course, I used slide 26 from the Week 13 Lecture about Error Handling and Libraries to help with my Automatic JSON Data Transformation.
    I looked at this demo code as well which gave me the idea of putting the boooks into boxes/containers.

    I unfortunately needed to use this website because I kept trying to type in "pop-up" screen into my code.
        https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp#:~:text=A%20modal%20is%20a%20dialog,Open%20Modal
    The rest of the links listed below are just videos I watched to make sure I understood what I was doing.
